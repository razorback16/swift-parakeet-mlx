# Phase 4: Audio Processing Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 successfully implements critical audio processing enhancements for the Swift Parakeet MLX library, focusing on fixing the Hanning window implementation and improving pre-emphasis filtering support.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Hanning Window Implementation
**Issue**: The original implementation used the formula `0.5 * (1.0 - cos(...))` which is mathematically equivalent to the standard formula but was missing proper edge case handling.

**Solution**:
- Updated to use the standard Hann window formula: `0.5 - 0.5 * cos(2πn/(N-1))`
- Added guard for length=1 case to prevent division by zero
- Ensured proper symmetry and endpoint values (0 at boundaries, ~1 at center)

**Code Location**: `/Sources/ParakeetMLX/AudioProcessing.swift` (lines 113-128)

### 2. Enhanced Pre-emphasis Filter
**Implementation**:
- Created dedicated `applyPreEmphasis` function with proper signal processing
- Formula: `y[n] = x[n] - α * x[n-1]` where α is typically 0.97
- First sample is preserved unchanged as per standard practice
- Added public `preEmphasis` function for standalone use

**Code Location**: `/Sources/ParakeetMLX/AudioProcessing.swift` (lines 78-94)

### 3. Improved STFT Implementation
**Enhancements**:
- Better window padding strategy (center padding instead of right padding)
- Improved reflection padding for signal boundaries
- Enhanced error handling for short signals
- Better documentation explaining the sliding window approach

**Code Location**: `/Sources/ParakeetMLX/AudioProcessing.swift` (lines 156-233)

### 4. Public API Additions
```swift
/// Apply pre-emphasis filter to audio signal
public func preEmphasis(_ audio: MLXArray, coefficient: Float = 0.97) -> MLXArray
```

## Technical Details

### Window Function Corrections
- **Before**: Simple implementation without edge case handling
- **After**: Robust implementation matching NumPy's `np.hanning()` behavior
- Proper handling of symmetric windows for spectral analysis

### Pre-emphasis Filter Benefits
- Amplifies high-frequency components
- Improves speech recognition accuracy by balancing the frequency spectrum
- Reduces effects of vocal tract resonances
- Standard coefficient of 0.97 works well for speech at 16kHz

### STFT Improvements
- Center-padded windows for better frequency resolution
- Reflection padding minimizes edge artifacts
- Proper frame extraction with sliding window
- Matches librosa's STFT implementation more closely

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite in `/Tests/AudioProcessingTests.swift`:
- Pre-emphasis filter verification
- Hanning window symmetry tests
- Window function value tests
- Integration tests with STFT pipeline

## Example Usage
Created demonstration example in `/examples/AudioProcessingExample.swift` showing:
- Pre-emphasis filter application
- Window function configuration
- Complete mel spectrogram generation with all enhancements

## Build Status
✅ **All builds successful** - The library compiles without errors or warnings related to audio processing.

## Integration Points
The enhanced audio processing integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing mel spectrogram generation
- Streaming audio processing (Phase 2)
- All model variants (CTC, RNNT, TDT-CTC from Phase 3)

## Performance Considerations
- Pre-emphasis is applied efficiently in a single pass
- Window functions are computed once and reused
- STFT uses optimized MLX operations for Apple Silicon

## Next Steps for Future Phases
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Additional window functions (Blackman-Harris, Kaiser)
- Configurable STFT padding modes
- Multi-channel audio support
- Real-time audio processing optimizations

## Files Modified
1. `/Sources/ParakeetMLX/AudioProcessing.swift` - Core enhancements
2. `/Package.swift` - Added test target
3. `/Tests/AudioProcessingTests.swift` - New test suite
4. `/examples/AudioProcessingExample.swift` - New demonstration code

## Conclusion
Phase 4 successfully addresses the critical audio processing issues, providing robust and efficient implementations that match the expected behavior from Python/NumPy implementations. The enhancements improve the overall quality and reliability of audio feature extraction for speech recognition tasks.
